Sentinel Guard - Use to build up Honey Net

Over the past few years, people have always talked excitedly about honeypot technology, all kinds of honeypot is emerge in endlessly, open source, commercial, low interactive, highly interactive, and so on, under normal circumstances, the general enterprise to the requirement of the honeypot actually is not high, and its essence require expensive deployment cost and not easy deployment, in companies with large network, the difficuty is also on the system operations of honeypot depens on the nubmer of honeypots you deployed; In addition, the number of honeypot probes in the internal network also determines the detection node distribution degree, and the distribution degree also determines the sensitivity of the transverse movement detection points in the internal network. Deployment is almost impossible to trigger without it. So is there a convenient and rapidly deployable internal honeypot solution? Of course, money is not a matter, exactly, I belong to the kind of moneyless. What do you do without money but talks security? Nothing except yourself! Therefore, based on Powershell script and Windows environment, I set up a sentinel guards to build up a honeynet with a pure ZERO cost , so as to realize whole-domain Windows host honeynet monitoring. In the most extreme, one-key whole-domain honeynet scheme can be realized simplely and quickly. What else do you still want under 0 cost? 0成本还要什么自行车？
